## About Me

I am a Research Fellow at Swinburne University of Technology. My research interest focuses on software/hardware security by using technologies such as fuzzing. I've published papers on top-tier venues, such as USENIX Security, CCS, TDSC and ICSE. I've been invited to serve as a reviewer in top-tier venues, such as IEEE IoTJ and IEEE TDSC.

## Research Interests

- **Cybersecurity:** software security, IoT security, fuzzing
<!-- - **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

## News

- **[May 2023]** Our research about type confusion detection in Windows COM is accepted to USENIX SEC 2023. Well done, Yuxing!
- **[Jan. 2022]** Our survey about fuzzing is accepted to ACM Computing Surveys.
- **[Dec. 2021]** Our paper about optimizing fuzzing schedule is accepted to ICSE 2022.
- **[Mar. 2021]** Our paper about IoT fuzzing is accepted to CCS 2021.
- **[Feb. 2021]** Our paper about regression greybox fuzzing is accepted to CCS 2021.
- **[Sep. 2020]** Our paper about full-speed fuzzing is accepted to TDSC.
- **[Mar. 2019]** Our paper about evaluation corpus for fuzzing is accepted to AsiaCCS 2019.
